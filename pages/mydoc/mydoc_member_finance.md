### Member Finance Summary

Worker CRM displays an extensive list of transactions associated to a member. All transactions have hyperlinks attached to them to enable a back office operator to navigate to the return, invoice, or transaction with ease.

Transactions will only appear for a member if they are contributing as a Self Employed, Contractor or Working Director.

Worker CRM also provides functionality to create new invoices, credit notes, or manage refunds (with workflow and approvals) from this page.
