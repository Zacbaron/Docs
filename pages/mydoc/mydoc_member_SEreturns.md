### Member Self Employed Summary

Self Employed Returns (SE Returns) are generated for members who are contributing as a Self Employed, Contractor or Working Director. A member may receive both Self Employed Contribution and Company (i.e. payroll) contributions from one or more companies in any period.  

The SE Returns page displays a list of SE returns associated to a member. MEMBER CRM displays returns in their different states, allowing a back office operator to intuitively see which returns are open, being edited, or have been finalised and paid out.

Back office operators are also able to create new SE Returns, or view the SE Returns more in depth, and view associated invoices and receipts for a return.
