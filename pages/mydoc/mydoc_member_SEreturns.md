### Member Self Employed Summary

Self Employed Returns (SE Returns) are generated for members who are contributing as a Self Employed, Contractor or Working Director. The is no restrictions for member to receive both Self Employed Contribution and contributions from one or more companies in the same period. 

The SE Returns page displays a comprehensive list of all the SE returns associated to the member. MEMBER CRM displays returns in their different states, allowing a back office operator to intuitively view what returns are open, being edited, or have been finalised and paid out.
