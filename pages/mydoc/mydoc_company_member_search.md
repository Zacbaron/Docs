Worker CRM features a keyword search function that is available for both members and companies. A back office operator is able to enter in any information regarding a member or company, for instance a name, phone number, address, registration ID etc. 

The back office operator can also filter the list by either Active, Inactive or Deregistered accounts. 

The Search page also displays recently accessed members or companies through the system, and can also be extended to show up to 20 results. The Company search function also enables operators to search by company contacts.
