### Entitlements

The Entitlements page displays a list of current and historical entitlements.

Members can create new claims from the member portal, and or edit claims prior to being approved/processed by a back office operator.

When submitting a return, a member must upload supporting documentation / proof of identity for an entitlement. The supporting documentation required is a copy of the member’s driver’s license and a current bank statement.
