### Company Finance Summary

The Finance page displays a comprehensive list of transactions associated to the company.
MEMBER CRM provides back office operators the ability to view the information in different formats by either transactions or invoices. All transactions have hyperlinks attached to them, so a back office user is able to navigate to the return or transaction with ease.

Back office operators also have the option to create new invoices, credit notes, or manage refunds from this page.
