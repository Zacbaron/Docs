### Company Finance Summary

The Finance page displays a comprehensive list of transactions associated to a company.
MEMBER CRM provides back office operators the ability to view financial information by transactions date, returns or invoices. All transactions have hyperlinks attached to them, so a back office operator is able to navigate to a specific return or transaction with ease.

Back office operators also have the option to create new invoices, credit notes, or manage refunds (with workflow and approvals) from this page.
