### Member Home Summary

The Home page displays an overall summary of the member details and recent activities. A back office operator is able to view important information such as contributions, and any tasks relating to the member. Back office operators can also edit details and access the memberâ€™s portal from this page.

MEMBER CRM enables a back office operator to impersonate a member on the portal (with limited functionality). This feature allows an operator to log into the portal on behalf of the member to assist in supporting members when using the portal.
