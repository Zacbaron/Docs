### My Member Card

Member CRM carries the functionality of Member Cards. If a fund requires members to have member cards, Member CRM has the option for companies to issue out member cards to their employees. The member cards can be canceled or reissued at any time, and allows members to request new member cards in case of damage of misplacement.
