### Member Entitlements Summary

MEMBER CRM displays a list of claims for a member. Back office operators can view, edit or delete previous claims, as well as create new claims.

Each claim displayed their state of completion and provides links to enable a back office operator to manage a claim from creation, approval, verification and payment.

Back office operators can create an entitlement for members. Members have the option to create entitlements once logged into the member portal.
