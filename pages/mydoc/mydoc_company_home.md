### Company Home Summary

The company home page displays an overview of the company profile. The dashboard allows back office users fast access to important areas, such as returns and any specific tasks required for the company. Back office operators can administer a companyâ€™s access to the portal, view associated members, access returns, and financial data.

Worker CRM enables back office operators to impersonate a company on the portal (with limited functionality). This feature allows an operator to log into the portal on behalf of the company to assist in supporting companies when using the portal.
