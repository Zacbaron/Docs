### Self Employed Returns

The SE Returns page displays a detailed list of all SE Returns associated to the account. Members can view, finalse, and pay returns from this page.

Member CRM displays the returns in their different states, so members are able to easily view which returns are in need of review, are being completed by the back office, or are paid.
