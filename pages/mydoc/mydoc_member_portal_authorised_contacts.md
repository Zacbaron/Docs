### Authorised Contacts

MEMBER CRM enables a member to associate one or more contacts for their account. For example, a member may create a contact for a family member, financial advisor, next of kin, or beneficiary etc.

Member CRM also keeps an audit of all members, current and archived, in a list to view at any time.
